# Problem Statement

To build a listings ads checkout system. 
We want to offer different products to property developers:
#### (i) Standard Ad : Offers the most basic level of advertisement
#### (ii) Featured Ad : Allows advertisers to use a company logo and use a longer presentation text
#### (iii) Premium Ad : Same benefits as Featured Ad, but also puts the advertisement at the top of

the results, allowing higher visibility
Each of the product is billed as follows:
#### ID Name Price
Standard Ad 269.99 RM
Featured Ad 322.99 RM
Premium Ad 394.99 RM

We established a number of special pricing rules for a small number of privileged customers:
#### (i) UEM Sunrise
- Gets a “3 for 2” deal on Standard Ads
#### (ii) Sime Darby Property Bhd.
- Gets a discount on Featured Ads where the price drops to 299.99 RM per ad
#### (iii) IGB Berhad
- Gets a discount on Premium Ads where 4 or more are purchased. The price drops to
379.99 RM per ad
#### (iv) Mah Sing Group
- Gets a “5 for 4” deal on Standard Ads
- Gets a discount on Featured Ads where the price drops to 309.99 RM per ad - Gets
a discount on Premium Ads
